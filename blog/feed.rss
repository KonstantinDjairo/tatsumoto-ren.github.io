<title>I don't know how to say something. Should I translate in my head?</title>
<author>Tatsumoto</author>
<description><![CDATA[<p>You should only say something you know is correct.
You know that a sentence is correct if you've heard a native speaker say it before.
Or if you've heard them say something very similar.
However, this may not always be possible.
In such cases, there are several options available to you.</p>
<p>First,
assume that anything that doesn't come from a native speaker is incorrect.
This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Machine translations from sources like Google or Deepl.</li>
<li>Sentences you construct using memorized words and grammar rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>Try searching examples online.
There are <a href="resources.html#examples-and-pronunciations">many websites that can help</a>.
By typing in the words you want to say,
you can find similar sentences in your target language.
You can also search in your Anki collection.
Chances are, you've mined a sentence that is close to what you want to say.</p>
<p>In a situation where you can't use the Internet,
your only option is to say something different.
Or to say what you've come up with yourself and remember to check later if it's correct.
Keep in mind that just because a native speaker understands you,
it does not mean the sentence is correct.
It may contain mistakes.</p>

<title>Is it a good idea to read mostly manga in the beginning?</title>
<author>Tatsumoto</author>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Immersion is immersion.
Consuming any native content is almost always the best strategy.
There are some pitfalls associated with reading manga,
but they're not too significant.
Still, I would rather immerse in anime as a beginner,
with manga taking a secondary role.</p>
<p>Firstly,
it's important to note that manga is not voiced, unlike anime.
Consequently,
often when reading you may get lost
because you won't know how to say certain words correctly and with the right pitch accent.
If you read something incorrectly, you may accidentally create a bad habit.</p>
<p>Since reading manga is reading immersion,
it is crucial to balance reading with listening.
Only through listening we can get exposure to native speech,
get used to the sounds of the language
and learn to understand speech without relying on textual cues.</p>
<p>You may not have access to high resolution scans.
Reading text on low-resolution images can be frustrating,
particularly when dealing with small text and complex kanji containing many strokes.</p>
<p>Lastly,
setting up a sentence mining workflow for manga
requires more steps compared to anime.
You need to learn how to use <abbr title="Optical character recognition">OCR software</abbr>,
and how to connect it with Japanese dictionaries and Anki,
which may be tedious for some people.
OCR software often makes mistakes when recognizing text from images,
and it can hinder your ability to quickly look up words.
In contrast,
when reading books or watching anime with TL subtitles
you don't have to rely on OCR.</p>

<title>Do I have to use an SRS?</title>
<author>Tatsumoto</author>
<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="whats-immersion.html">Immersion</a> is the cornerstone of <a href="whats-ajatt.html">AJATT</a>,
with the <a href="spaced-repetition.html">SRS</a> serving as an optional supplement.
While <a href="setting-up-anki.html">Anki</a>
or other SRS applications can be useful for helping learn vocabulary faster,
it is possible to become fluent without using them.
If using an SRS reduces your motivation or enjoyment,
it may be in your best interest to forgo using any SRS
and instead focus on the core of the method.</p>
<p>To improve learning speed and efficiency,
it is recommended to incorporate some form of repetition,
provided <a href="minimum-amount-of-anki.html">you can tolerate it</a>.
We eventually forget <a href="how-much-reading-is-required-to-counteract-not-srsing.html">everything that we don't review</a>.
While total, mass immersion can partially counteract the forgetting curve,
it can't help when trying to memorize more uncommon words.</p>
<p>In the case of Japanese,
the SRS proves especially useful
because it helps you learn how to read words written in kanji
and ensures that you don't forget kanji readings.
It is particularly helpul when dealing with rare kanji.</p>
<p>Personally,
I have observed that the majority of my failed Anki reviews
stem from forgotten kanji readings.
I may recall the meaning of a word, but struggle to recall its pronunciation.
Therefore, if your target language does not utilize kanji or hanzi characters,
it is totally fine to omit the use of Anki.</p>

<title>Can I speak early?</title>
<author>Tatsumoto</author>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Generally,
<a href="whats-ajatt.html">AJATT</a> does not recommend speaking (or outputting) early.
Typically,
this means avoiding speaking in the first 1 to 2 years,
or until your comprehension reaches fluency.
AJATT's core philosophy is based on learning to
understand your target language before you start outputting.
We have found that waiting until you have accumulated
<a href="mass-immersion.html">10,000 hours</a>
of input yields better results when you start learning to speak.</p>
<p>Speaking early is <a href="bad-habits-due-to-being-forced-to-prematurely-output.html">associated with long-term negative effects</a>
which require time and deliberate practice to fix later.</p>
<p>We highly recommend immersing yourself in the language for 10,000 hours
and then starting practicing speaking by imitating native speakers,
a technique known as &quot;shadowing.&quot;</p>
<p>Alternative approaches,
such as trying to find native speakers to talk to,
often result in frustration.
When you're still a beginner,
you will be making a ton of mistakes.
Native speakers are not motivated to notice, point out, and correct your mistakes.
They just want to speak English with you.
Natives will be annoyed by you and will try to speak to you as if you were a baby,
using very simple language.
You won't learn much from such conversations.
That's why your time during the beginner stage is better spent immersing.</p>
<p>Furthermore,
for Japanese learners
it is extremely challenging
to find someone who understands the pitch accent theory,
knows pitch accent rules,
and can assist in developing a native-like accent.
Self-study has proven to be the most effective method for achieving this objective.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Managing time effectively is crucial to accomplish tasks and maintain productivity.
Timeboxing is a popular technique that helps people organize their time.
In this article,
we will explore the concept of timeboxing,
how timeboxing can help with language learning,
and discuss timeboxing software that AJATTers use.</p>

<title>If you're almost done with Tango N5, is it worth switching to the KanjiTransition deck?</title>
<author>Tatsumoto</author>
<description><![CDATA[<p>No.
The <a href="learning-kanji.html#jp1k-method">JP1K method</a>
was invented so that people can skip RTK
(or any other <a href="learning-kanji.html#isolated-kanji-study">isolated kanji</a> study deck).
For a lot of people learning kanji out of context is boring and difficult.
The benefit of the JP1K method is that you can start learning
from authentic Japanese sentences almost from the start
instead of spending time on memorizing individual characters.
If you've basically finished the <a href="basic-vocabulary.html#anki-deck">Tango N5</a> deck,
it's safe to assume that you've already got enough kanji reading ability
to continue learning vocabulary from native content.
Moreover, the <a href="jp1k-anki-deck.html">KanjiTransition deck</a> is largely based on Tango N5.
The only thing that's different is the card template.
So there's no point in studying the same material twice.</p>

<title>Why shouldn't I just keep using an app instead?</title>
<author>Tatsumoto</author>
<description><![CDATA[<p>We do not recommend &quot;language learning&quot; apps like Duolingo, Lingodeer, Babbel,
and others due to the fact that their methodology conflicts with <a href="whats-ajatt.html">AJATT</a>'s
principles of <a href="whats-immersion.html">immersion</a> learning.
Such apps do not actually help you with anything.
There are no success stories.
On the other hand, AJATTers typically reach fluency in just 18 months.
The apps prevent you from reading interesting content in your target language, such as manga.
And they make you more miserable in the end.</p>

<title>Does playing Japanese audio on repeat while I sleep count as immersion?</title>
<author>Tatsumoto</author>
<description><![CDATA[<p>It doesn't.
And, generally, it is not recommended.
But if you understand the mechanics behind this idea,
you may consider doing it and get some, although little, benefit.</p>
<p>It is important to note that humans cannot learn anything while sleeping.
There is no research that suggests that we can.
As far as I know, the idea was popularized by the old AJATT website.
AJATT is about <a href="mass-immersion.html">mass immersion</a>, doing Japanese all the time.
The reason why some AJATTers have Japanese audio playing
when they sleep is not because you can learn something while you sleep,
but because you will be hearing Japanese speech
just before falling asleep and just after waking up.
You can be exposed to the language more by doing this trick.
If you pause Japanese before going to bed,
there will be some time,
maybe just a few minutes,
when you are not immersing.</p>
<p>The other side is that
any additional learning progress that could be made by the extra listening time
will be canceled out by low-quality sleep.
Playing audio while you're trying to sleep can disrupt you.
If you're constantly being jolted awake by the audio,
you're not going to get the restorative sleep you need to function at your best.
Sleeping properly is an essential aspect of the language acquisition process
and should not be compromised.
A solution would be to use some technology to pause the audio after falling asleep
and resuming it just before it's time to wake up.
For example,
an alarm clock app that has a feature to trigger a podcast app or a music app
instead of playing a preset alarm sound by itself.</p>
