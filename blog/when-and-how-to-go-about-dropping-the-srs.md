You should never stop using the SRS,
even after you <abbr title="Master your target language">make it</abbr>.

If you stop using the SRS,
you'll notice that you have
[forgotten many things](how-much-reading-is-required-to-counteract-not-srsing.html)
here and there that you used to know.
Maybe you would still like to remember them because you could use them yourself in your output.

If a word is rare enough,
you'd be unable to maintain it in your memory only through immersion.
This is assuming you don't hone your immersion to the language domain
where the word appears more frequently.

A few minutes of SRSing each day is a hundred times better than no SRSing at all.
So instead try to reduce the time spent SRSing
by adding less new cards
and [deleting cards with very large intervals](how-to-review.html#card-retirement).
